# Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System

This simple CRM system is a web-based application that allows store admins to manage their customer relationships and orders. The main dashboard allows admins to view the number of orders, which orders have been delivered, which orders are awaiting payment, and which orders are in preparation. Additionally, admins can view customer information and access a dashboard where they can create orders, view the customer's prior purchases, and update their customer information.
